# 1. Historical Roots of Deep Learning

Deep Learning has its root in 1940's, when **Warren McCulloch** and **Warren Pitts** published the concept of Artificial Neuron, also referred to as **MCP Neuron** in 1943 (A Logical Calculus of the Ideas Immanent in Nervous Activity by W.S McCulloch and W.Pitts, Bulletin of Mathetmatical Biophysics, 5(4): 115-133, 193)
[Reference](https://www.historyofinformation.com/detail.php?id=634)
and [Link to Paper](http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~coquand/AUTOMATA/mcp.pdf)

They drew on the three sources to come up with the concept of Artificial Neurons:

- knowledge of basic psychology and functions of neuron brain
- a formal analysis of propositional logic by **Russell** and **Whitehead**, and
- Turing's **Theory of Computation**

## 1.1 McCulloch Pitt's Neuron

The concept of artificial neuron was inspired by the **Biological Neurons** which are interconnected nerve cells in the brain and are involved in the processing and transmitting of various signals, which is illustrated in figure below:

A single neuron in its simplified explanation consists of following parts:

- **SOMA**: the main part of the neuron which processes signal.
- **DENDRITES**: the branch-like shapes which receives signals from other neurons (i.e. are input to neuron), and
- **AXON**: a single nerve which sends signals to other neurons (i.e., is an output of the neuron)

and the connections between the nerurons are known as **SYNAPSES**

The idea of the **McCulloch Pitts Neuron** was to provide the abstractions on how the brain neuron works, and was considered as a simple logic gate which receives

- multiple input binary signals (equivalent to dendrites),
- binary output i.e. **ON** or **OFF** state (i.e. output of neuron, equivalent to Axon),
- and the neruron fires if the accumulates signal of all the inputs have enough stimulation in it, or in other words is above certain threshold.
